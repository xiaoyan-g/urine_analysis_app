# urine_analysis_app

Urine Analysis App reports on the health of a user based off of the chemical reaction of the molecules in your pee on a urine test. You must upload a picture of your urine test to the webapp, and a computer vision model will identify markers in your strip. After this, you will get a table sumarizing all compounds found in your urine and a status report of the users health. With this webapp, anyone can determine their current health based off of a urine test strip before reaching the doctor. 

**NOTE: This tool isn't built to replace doctors as their education and experiance hold value. Rather, this can be equivalent as a simple blood preassure test that (while following instructions) can recieve an accurate and precise reading.**
